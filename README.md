Music Recommendation System
Overview
This project implements a reinforcement learning-based music recommendation system that suggests songs to users based on their preferences and feedback. The system learns from user ratings to improve its recommendations over time.

Features:

Personalized Recommendations: Adapts to user preferences through feedback

Exploration-Exploitation Balance: Uses an epsilon-greedy approach to balance known preferences with new discoveries

Feature-Based Matching: Recommends songs based on musical features and eras

Interactive Interface: Simple command-line interface for user interaction

Project Structure:

music_recommender/
**init**.py

main.py # Main execution script

config.py # Configuration constants

data_loader.py # Data loading functions

recommender.py # Recommendation logic

utils.py # Utility functions

ui.py # User interface functions

Data Format:

The system expects a CSV file named songs.csv in the ../data/ directory with the following format:

Each row represents a song

First column is the song title (used as index)

Following columns represent features (21 features as defined in config.py)

Example features: decade (1980s, 1990s, etc.), genre (Pop, Rock, etc.)

How to Use:

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-recommender.git
   cd music-recommender
   Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare your data:

Place your songs.csv file in the ../data/ directory relative to the project

Ensure the CSV matches the expected format (see Data Format section)

Run the system:

python main.py

First, select your preferred music features

Then rate the initial recommendations

Continue receiving and rating recommendations

Customization:

You can modify several parameters in config.py:

S: Hyperparameter controlling utility calculation

NFEATURE: Number of features in your dataset

START_CONSTANT: Controls how quickly the system adapts to early ratings

FEATURES: List of feature names that match your dataset

Algorithm Details
The system uses:

Utility Function: Computes song relevance based on user preferences and recency

Epsilon-Greedy Strategy: Balances exploration and exploitation

Iterative Mean Update: Adjusts user preferences based on ratings

Future Improvements:

Add more sophisticated recommendation algorithms

Implement user persistence (save/load user profiles)

Add visualization of recommendation patterns

Support for larger datasets with optimized performance
